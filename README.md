A quick template for creating MERN projects.

## Installation

Clone this repo to your local machine by running the following command in the desired directory:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/heyLukey/mern-template.git
```

Open the project up in an IDE and create two terminals.

In terminal 1:
```bash
cd backend
npm i 
```
In terminal 2:
```bash
cd frontend
npm i
```

## Usage
Running the project requires two terminals, one for backend and one for frontend.

nodemon index.js
```
In terminal 2:

(Note that backend setup may require the appropriate .env file.)
